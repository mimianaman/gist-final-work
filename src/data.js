  is to know how the young ones feel about STEM at each stage , to get the
  actual ratio of the girls interested in STEM now . 
  This will give us a more vivid idea on how to address the matter. this
  survey is for both girls and boys .
  Programs are tailored to match the age group being addressed. These
  could be in the form of field trips, talks , workshop etc. 
  GIST seeks to expand outreach to all the regions in Ghana and ensure

  title: "About Us",
  body: `It is seen that there are very few women in the STEM field , this can be
    associated to stereotypes, gender bias and the lack of knowledge on the
    opportunities available to them. 
    Research shows that most females in Ghana are targeted at the secondary
    and tertiary education levels where a career path has already been
    chosen based on their course selection. 
    GIST is a foundation focused on introducing girls to careers in STEM at
    an early age in schools from basic four (4) upwards. Girls like to see
    themselves in older women hence our 
    approach is to have female in this field serve as blueprints for younger
    ones. 
    As our acronym GIST suggests, we aim to cover the essence and substance
    of the matter and substance of the matter, hence the motto " Addressing
    the heart of the matter" 
    GIST is here to open the minds of our young females on the endless
    career opportunities out there . 
    By involving females already in the field , the young ones become
    informed about the realities on the ground based on our experiences.
    This is to eleminate the ideology that STEM 
    is boring`,

  mission: `Introducing girls to STEM in their formative years`,
  missionOne: ` Kindle girls interest in STEM`,
  missionTwo: ` Educative and Informative programs`,
  missionThree: ` Mentorship`,
  missionFour: `Awareness of challenges that could be faced and how to deal with it`,
  missionFive: `Increasing self-confidence and promoting teamwork`,

  vision: `Vision
   Create a future where an appreciable percentage of women are recognised
   in Ghana in the STEM field and ensuring continuos support and
   encouragement to the younger ones .`
